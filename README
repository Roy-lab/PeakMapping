Compilation: g++ *.C -g -o MapPeaksToGenes 
Usage: ./mapPeaksToGenes gfffile chromnamemap sites single|double output windowSizeUp windowSizeDown pFName

This version of the mapping code has been updated to allow for an asymmetric distance in the mapping of peaks/sites to genes with the windowSizeUp and windowSizeDown arguments in the command. I've set up a working example in the example subdorectory, and the MapPeaks.sh script should assist in presenting any of the particulars.

The gff file must have the following format, which was implemented for simplicity. See the full usage in MapPeaks.sh for particulars. 

The example input formats for the GFF file and the peak/sites file are as follows:

If you have a file with more columns, as long as the format has a peak name string in the 4th column, you can use that file unchanged. Of course the code can be updated to reat the peak/site names from any chosen column if a user wishes. 

The output information is in two files, one summarizing the mappings, and one summarizing the peaks that are not mapped. 

The first output file is that of the peaks that are mapped, and it has the following format:

head example/test_output.txt 
peak1	MtrunA17CPg0492321	MtrunA17CP	12109	13419	2413
peak1	MtrunA17CPg0492341	MtrunA17CP	12109	13419	6414
peak1	MtrunA17CPg0492351	MtrunA17CP	12109	13419	8903
peak2	MtrunA17CPg0492321	MtrunA17CP	15572	16356	-787

peak3	MtrunA17CPg0492421	MtrunA17CP	26327	26647	2664

1. peak name
2. gene name
3-5. peak coodinates in standard formatting of chr/start/stop
6. distance relative to gene TSS, with + values reflecting upstream mapping. 

All mappings are done from the center of the peak/site relative to the gene TSS. 

If a given peak is mapped to the given wiindow of more than one gene TSS, then it will be listed as mapped to each of those genes. 

The second output file of peaks/sites that are not mapped to genes is in pFName, a list of the non-mapped peaks.
